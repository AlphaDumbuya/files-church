    <h3>What We Believe ........</h3>
    <p>
        Jesus answered them, and said, my doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. (John 7:16,17)
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong>Inspiration of Scriptures</strong></p>
    <p>
        We believe that the Holy Bible is the written Word of the Living God. We believe it was inspired by the Holy Spirit and recorded by holy men of old. It is infallible in content and a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction which is truth without any mixture of error. The Bible reveals the principles by which God will judge us and reveals His great plan of salvation. It will remain eternally. We believe the Bible is the true center of Christian union and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and opinions should be tried. Therefore, we believe this Word should go into all the world and should be given first place in every believer's life (2 Timothy 3:16; Hebrews 4:12; 1 Peter 1:23-25; 2 Peter 1:19-21).
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong>The Godhead</strong></p>
    <p>
        We believe there is but one true and living God who is everlasting, and infinite in power, wisdom, and goodness.  He is the creator of all things, visible and invisible and preserver of all things (Gen. 1:1, Col. 1:16) In the unity of the Godhead, there are three persons of one individual essence who are co-equal , co-existent and co-eternal, namely the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. (Matt. 3:16-17, Matt. 28: 18 - 19, 2 Cor. 13:14, John 1:1, John 5: 6-18, Phil. 2:6, Heb. 9:14, John 14: 26, 15:26, 10:33). In eternal relationship the Father is greater than all (John 14:28, I Cor. 15:28, John 5:18)
    </p>
    <p>
        The Son is the eternally begotten of the Father, and accepted earthly limitations being true God and man. Conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of the virgin Mary, he died on the cross, for the just for the unjust as a substitutionary sacrifice, and  all who believe in him are justified on the grounds of his shed blood. He arose from the dead according to the scriptures ascended into heaven and is now seated on the right hand of the Father making intercession for us as our high priest  (Matt 26:64, Luke 22:69, Mark 16:19, Acts 2:34, Rom  8:27, 34, 1 Pet  3:22, Acts 1:6 - 11) and will return again to establish his kingdom of righteousness and of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Holy Ghost is the third person of the trinity, executive of the Godhead on the earth, the comforter sent by the Lord Jesus Christ to indwell , to guide and to teach those who have been saved from their sin, and to convince the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment  (John 14:15 - 26, Luke 12:11,12).

    </p>
    <p class="titles"> <strong>Man, His Fall and Redemption</strong></p>
    <p>
        Man is a created being, made in the likeness and image of God, but through Adam and Eveâ€™s  transgression and fall, sin came into the world (Rom. 5:12) All have sinned and come short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). As it is written, there is none righteous, no not one (Rom. 3:10). Jesus Christ, the son of God, was manifested to man and gave his life and shed blood to redeem and restore man back to God. (I John 3:8).
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong> Salvation</strong></p>
    <p>
        Salvation is made possible through the shed blood of Jesus Christ as the sacrifice on the cross. Godly sorrow works repentance through the spiritual conviction of the Holy Ghost. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Salvation is possible by confessing that you are a sinner in need of forgiveness of your sins.(Rom. 10: 9 -14, 1 John 1:9)
        Believing that Jesus is the Son of God and that he died on the cross and rose on the third day (Luke 23:44-46, 24:36-49).
        Believing that Jesus ascended into heaven and now sits on the right hand of God making intercession for us (Luke 22:69)
        This is how the new birth occurs, which we call being "born again." Salvation is possible only through God's grace, not by our works.  Works are the fruit of salvation (Acts 3:19,20, Rom. 4:1-5, 5:1; Ephesians 2:8-10). Man is a free moral agent and can at any time after the new birth experience, turn away from God and die in a state of sin, with the consequences of hell to look forward to.
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong>Baptism of the Holy Ghost</strong></p>
    <p>
        The baptism of the Holy Ghost (Matt. 3:11) is a gift from God as promised by Jesus Christ to all believers in this dispensation, and is received subsequent to (after) the new birth experience (John 14:16,17, Acts 1:8, 2:4, 38,39, 10: 44- 48). The baptism of the Holy Ghost is accompanied with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues as the Holy Ghost gives the utterance or the ability to speak (Acts 2:4). The gift of the Holy Ghost is to lead, teach and empower (John 14: 16 - 26).

    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong>Water Baptism</strong></p>
    <p>
        Baptism in water by immersion, is a commandment of our Lord (Matt. 28:19), subsequent to (after) the new birth experience. This ordinance is a symbol of the Christians identification with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6: 4, Col. 2:12, Acts 8: 36 - 39). Therefore the baptizing of infants and younger children is not scriptural. Per the instruction given by the Lord Jesus Christ, we baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost (Matt. 28:19).

    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong> The Lords Supper</strong></p>
    <p>
        The ordinance of the Lords Supper is a commandment of our Savior (Matt. 26:29, I Cor. 11:23-34). It is a memorial to his death and resurrection, and is strictly limited to born again believers. (1 Cor. 11:27) The time and frequency of the observance is left to the discretion of each congregation / organization (1 Cor. 11:26). Unfermented grape juice (fruit of the vine, Matt. 26: 29) should be used.
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong> Sanctification</strong></p>
    <p>
        The Bible teaches that without Holiness no man can see the Lord (Heb. 12: 14). We believe in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite, yet progressive work of grace commencing at the time of regeneration and continuing until the consummation of salvation /death of the natural man. (Heb. 13:12, II Thes. 2:13, I Pet. 1:2,  Eph. 5:26, I Cor. 6:11, John 17:17, I Thes. 5:23).
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong>Divine Healing</strong></p>
    <p>
        We believe God has used doctors, medicines, and other natural means as channels of healing; however, we believe divine healing is provided for believers in the atonement made by Jesus' blood shed on the cross (Isaiah 53:5; 1 Peter 2:24). We believe divine healing may be received by the laying on of hands by the elders (James 5:14-16), by the prayer of an anointed person gifted by the Holy Spirit for healing the sick (1 Corinthians 12:9), or by a direct act of receiving this provision by faith (Mark 11:23,24).
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong> Heaven and Hell</strong></p>
    <p>
        We believe Scripture clearly sets forth the doctrines of eternal punishment for the lost and eternal bliss and service for the saved -- a literal hell for the unsaved and Heaven for the saved (Matthew 25: 34,41,46, Luke 16:19-31, John 14:1-3, Revelation 20:11-15).
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong> The Body of Christ</strong></p>
    <p>
        We believe the Body of Christ is made up of all who have been "born again" (Rom. 10:9 -13). We believe in the spirit of unity, while allowing for variety in individual ministries as to their work, calling, and location as directed by the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:34,35, 1 Corinthians 12:12-31).
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong>Marriage Between Man and Woman</strong></p>
    <p>
        We believe in the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman.  (Gen. 2:22 -24, Lev. 18:22, Matt. 19:4-6, Eph. 5:31-33, Rom. 1:16-32)
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong>The Rapture of The Church</strong></p>
    <p>
        The Bible promises, this same Jesus shall so come in like manner (Acts 1: 11), his coming is imminent. When he comes, the dead in Christ shall rise first, and they which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. (I Thes. 4:16,17)
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong>Second Coming</strong></p>
    <p>
        We believe in the return of Christ Jesus to this earth, with His Bride (Acts 1:10,11; 1 Thes. 4:13-18; 2 Thes. 1:7-10, James 5:8, Rev. 1:7). Following the tribulation, Jesus will shall return to earth as King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and together with his saints (Rev. 19:11-21).
    </p>
    <p class="titles"><strong> Offerings</strong></p>
    <p>
        Offerings are for the for the support of the active ministry, for the propagation of the gospel  and for the general work of the Lord. (II Cor. 9:6-15).
